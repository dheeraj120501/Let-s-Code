## Core Fundamentals of TOC

## Operations on a Language

Union

Intersection

Complement

Kleene's Closure

## Model of Computation

There are many kind of Automata some of them are:

- Finite Automata or Finite State Machine
- Pushdown Automata or Pushdown Machine
- Linear Bound Automata or Linear Bound Machine
- Turing Machine

Machine and Automaton means the same thing in TOC.

- Automata is the plural of Automaton.
