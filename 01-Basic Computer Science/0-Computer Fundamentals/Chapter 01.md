## 0 Early Computing (Electromechanical Computing)
-  Computers are just simple machines that perform complex actions through many layers of abstraction.
-  Abacus was first computing device.
-  Multiplication and Division are just looped addition and subtraction.
-  Idea of `Difference Engine` by Charles Babbage used for calculation of polynomials.
-  `Analytical Engine` was also the idea of Charles babage which unlike other early computers was a general purpose computer.
	-  an “automatic computer” – one that could guide itself through aseries of operations automatically

## 1 Electronic Computing
- One of the largest electro-mechanical computers built was the `Harvard Mark I`, completed in 1944 by IBM for the Allies during World War 2.
	- It contained 765,000 components, three million connections, and five hundred miles of wire.
	- The brains of these huge electro-mechanical beasts were `relays`: electrically-controlled mechanical switches.
	- Unfortunately, the mechanical arm inside of a relay **has mass**, and therefore can’t move instantly between opened and closed states.
	- In addition to slow switching speed, another limitation was wear and tear, and replacement problems of these huge monster like brains.
	- These huge computers also attracted insects which cause problems in them, and from then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, people said it had `bugs` in it.
- Next replacement of relay comes in the form `Triode Vaccum tubes`, positively charged they allow flow of electron and thus completing the ckt, negetively charges they stop the ckt. But they werre too fragile and burn down easily.
- The first large-scale use of vacuum tubes for computing was the `Colossus Mk 1` designed by engineer Tommy Flowers, it helped to decrypt Nazi communications.
	- This is refered as forst programable computer. 
-  `Alan Turing`, often called the **father of computer science**, had created an electromechanical device, also at Bletchley Park, called the `Bombe`, to break Nazi Enigma codes, but the Bombe wasn’t technically a computer.
-   The `Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator` or `ENIAC`  designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, this was the **world's first truly general purpose, programmable, electronic computer**.
	-    It was operational for ten years, and is estimated to have done more arithmetic than the entire human race up to that point.
	-    But once again a large number or vaccum tubes and the burning and replacement problem.
- By the 1950’s, even vacuum-tube-based computing was reaching its limits, so then came transistor.
- The `IBM 608`, released in 1957 the first fully transistor-powered, commercially-available computer.
- Today, computers use transistors that are smaller than 50 nanometers in size, they can switch states millions of times per second, and can run for decades.
- **`Remember electronic computers are all about switching state, open the ckt and close the ckt. It's all about how fast you can do it.`**
