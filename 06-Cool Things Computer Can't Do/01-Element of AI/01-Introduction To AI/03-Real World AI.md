# Odds and probability

In real world instead of perfect information, there is a host of unknown possibilities, ranging from missing information to deliberate deception.

- Along with data in real world we often encounter some errors and inaccuracies called **noise**.

One of the reasons why modern AI methods actually work in real-world problems – as opposed to most of the earlier “good old-fashioned" methods in the 1960-1980s – is their ability to deal with uncertainty.

- Probability has turned out to be the best approach for reasoning under uncertainty, and almost all current AI applications are based, to at least some degree, on probabilities.
