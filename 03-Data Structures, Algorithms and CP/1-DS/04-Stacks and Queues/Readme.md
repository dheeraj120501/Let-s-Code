# Introduction

They are collection of items. The difference is in where to insert an item?, and which item to be removed?. Stacks are last-in-first-out (LIFO), while queues are first-in-first-out (FIFO).

- The main operations of a stack are push, pop, isEmpty, top and can be implemented using LinkedLists or Arrays.
- The main operations of a queue are enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty and can be implemented using LinkedLists or Arrays.
